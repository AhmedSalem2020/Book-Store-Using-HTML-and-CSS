What is a good mystery novel without a thrilling crime to solve and a dogged detective with a penchant for logical deduction? Whether it is kidnapping, 
theft or murder, a good detective novel draws readers in and keeps them hooked with new clues and startling revelations. It’s not always hardboiled sleuths
that are called upon to crack the cases either. Sometimes ordinary people find themselves caught up in extraordinary circumstances where they are forced to pit
their wits against some villains.
