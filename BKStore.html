Although Westerns appear to have fallen out of favor with modern audiences,
they were once a staple of boththe literary and film world. Contemporary shows,
such as West World, has put a new science fiction spin on the genre,but readers
yearning for tales set in the American Old West frontier have less newer
material to choose from. </b>

Mention the word “espionage” and most people think of James Bond. However,
the cloak-and-dagger genre of literature has a lot more spies than Ian Fleming’s
most famous creation. In fact,even Sherlock Holmes, the fictional detective brought
to life by Arthur Conan Doyle dabbled in some double agent duties in a few of his books. 
While not all spies have gone on to receive blockbuster film adaptations, 
it doesn’t make their adventures any less riveting. </b>

			<h3> Five Free Thrilling Detective Novels</h3>

What is a good mystery novel without a thrilling crime to solve and a dogged 
detective with a penchant for logical deduction? Whether it is kidnapping, 
theft or murder, a good detective novel draws readers in and keeps them hooked 
with new clues and startling revelations. It’s not always hardboiled sleuths
that are called upon to crack the cases either. Sometimes ordinary people find
themselves caught up in extraordinary circumstances where they are forced to pit
their wits against some villains. </b>
