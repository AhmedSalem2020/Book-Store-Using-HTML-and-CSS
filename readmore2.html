Mention the word “espionage” and most people think of James Bond. However, the cloak-and-dagger genre of literature has a lot more spies than Ian Fleming’s
most famous creation. In fact,even Sherlock Holmes, the fictional detective brought to life by Arthur Conan Doyle dabbled in some double agent duties in a few of his books. 
While not all spies have gone on to receive blockbuster film adaptations,it doesn’t make their adventures any less riveting.
